		"description": "The Autocaster is an embedded system based around a Digilent Atlys FPGA board, developed by Russell Joyce as a final year project for the MEng Computer Science with Embedded Systems Engineering course.\n\nThe project's original title was 'Guitar Hero on FPGA', which evolved into a system that can autonomously play both Rock Band and Guitar Hero games running on a PlayStation 3.\n\nThe demo above shows the system monitoring the HDMI graphics from a games console and playing a song by mimicking a USB guitar controller.",

		"description": "The ultrasonic maze robot was developed by Phil Greenland for a final year project in Computer Science with Embedded Systems Engineering, with the aim of creating a robot to navigate a maze using ultrasonic sensors.\n\nThe system developed consists of four main components: an FPGA development board which can be seen sat on top of the platform; a mobile platform on which everything is mounted; sensor boards which perform the ultrasound generation and capture as part of the ultrasonic imaging system; and a mainboard which provides an interface between the FPGA, mobile platform and sensor boards while containing additional hardware required by the ultrasonic imaging system.",
