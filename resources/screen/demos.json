		"description": "The ultrasonic maze robot was developed by Phil Greenland for a final year project in Computer Science with Embedded Systems Engineering, with the aim of creating a robot to navigate a maze using ultrasonic sdensors. The system developed consists of four main components: an FPGA development board which can be seen sat on top of the platform; a mobile platform on which everything is mounted; sensor boards which perform the ultrasound generation and capture as part of the ultrasonic imaging system; and a mainboard which provides an interface between the FPGA, mobile platform and sensor boards while containing additional hardware required by the ultrasonic imaging system.",
